Multinational corporations, as well as individual citizens, are in desperate need of digital accounting systems to better facilitate their wealth management. 

  The problem is, even though there have been products managing users' wealth by various means, the available tools are unsatisfactory in personalization to meet some needs that users may have in the daily financial management, such as budget setting according to the users' income status and spending patterns or help users to set their financial goal. 

  This programme acts as an accounting system to help users manage their financial state. By processing the records of income and expense as well as other financial information through this programme, users can have a better understanding and management of their wealth.
