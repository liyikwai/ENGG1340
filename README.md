### **1.Problem Statement**
  In recent years, as information technology rapidly develops, digital tools are widely available in various areas, including the financial sector. Multinational corporations, as well as individual citizens, are in desperate need of digital accounting systems to better facilitate their wealth management. 

  The problem is, even though there have been products managing users' wealth by various means, the available tools are unsatisfactory in personalization to meet some needs that users may have in the daily financial management, such as budget setting according to the users' income status, spending patterns or help users to set their financial goal. 

  This programme acts as an accounting system to help users manage their financial state. By processing the records of income and expense as well as other financial information through this programme, users can have a better understanding and management of their wealth. 
  
### **2.Problem Setting**
  We assume that the maximum number of the user input is less than 100,000,000 to avoid overflow. Besides, Income and expense received should be rounded to two decimals. In addition, the user is expected not to input negative numbers. Furthermore, the information provided by user should be meaningful and valid. For example, the user cannot input invalid dates like 32/02/2019 (32nd February 2019). 
 
  We divide this problem into 7 functionalities. 
  1. _Adding Record_: This function is to record the user's monthly income and expenses. The data will be stored in two dynamic arrays income[] and expense[]. A file named "Financial_Records.txt" containing the information that the user input will be created.
 
  2. _Offering Basic Information_: This function is to show detailed information of the records. This will be done by opening and reading the data from "Financial_Records.txt".
  
  3. _Editing and Deleting_: This function is to let the user edit or delete the records. This action will be done by applying the method of array insertion and deletion. After editing, the array will be sorted by the method of bubble sort.The data in "Financial_Records.txt" will also be updated.
  
  4. _Searching the Records_: This function to let user easily search for and review the records which he or she has input into the programme. This searching purpose will be achieved by applying linear search to the dynamic struct array.
  
  5. _Offering Financial Report_: This function is to calculate different parameter that could report the user's financial situation. 
  
  6. _Setting Budget_: This function is to allow the user to create their own budget setting. Whenever the user adding his or her expense, it will calculate the cumulative expense and check whether the expense exceeeds the budget or not.
  
  7. _Setting and Estimating the Goal_: This function allows the user to set up his or her goals such as buying a property or other products. After that, it will estimate whether the user are capable to achieve the goal. If they are able to do so, it will calculate the time they needed.
