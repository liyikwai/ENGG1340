### **1.Problem Statement**
  In recent years, as information technology rapidly develops, digital tools are widely available in various areas, including the financial sector. Multinational corporations, as well as individual citizens, are in desperate need of digital accounting systems to better facilitate their wealth management. 

  The problem is, even though there have been products managing users' wealth by various means, the available tools are unsatisfactory in personalization to meet some needs that users may have in the daily financial management, such as budget setting according to the users' income status, spending patterns or help users to set their financial goal. 

  This programme acts as an accounting system to help users manage their financial state. By processing the records of income and expense as well as other financial information through this programme, users can have a better understanding and management of their wealth. 
  
### **2.Problem Setting**
  We assume that the maximum number that the user input is less than 100000000 to avoid overflow. Besides, Income and expense received should be rounded to two decimals. In addition, the user is expected not to input negative number. Furthermore, the information provided by user should be meaningful and valid. For example, the user cannot input invalid dates like 32/2/2019 (32th Feburary 2019). 
 
  We divide this problem into 7 functionalities. 
  1. _Adding records of income and expense_: This function to record the user's monthly income and expenses.
  2. _Offering basic information of the records_: This function to provide detailed information of the records.
  3. _Editing and deleting the records_: This function to let user edit or delete the records. 
  4. _Searching the records_: This function to let user easily search for and review the records which s/he has input into the programme.
  5. _Offering report of usersâ€™ financial state_: This function is to calculate different data that could report the user's financial situation.
  6. _Setting budget_: This function is to allow user to create their own budget setting.
  7. _Setting and estimating user's goal_: This function allows user to set up his or her goals such as buying a property or other products. After that, it will estimate the time and money they needed to achieve the goals.
